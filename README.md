## Tasks
1.  Generate pseudo-annotations for video data.
2. Build an object detection pipeline that can train on your annotations.
3. Create an evaluation procedure with visualizations of predictions and annotations
4. Design a process to iteratively improve your dataset. 
<br><br>
Dataset: [Sports-1M](https://github.com/naomichoy/ball-detection-sports1m/tree/main) -- [Repo](https://github.com/gtoderici/sports-1m-dataset/tree/master)

## Setup Requirements
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br>
Clone the Sports-1M repository, place it under the same parent directory as this repository

## Data processing pipeline steps
### 1. Download Youtube videos from links listed in the Sports-1M dataset repository

```youtube_download.py```
- Take video links from original/train_partition.txt
- mapping the sports class number label with labels.txt
- Only use sports that involves a ball, listed in ```TARGET_LABEL_NAME```
- Using yt-dlp module
- Videos are saved by class
- Set to download a total of 300 videos (adjustable)

### 2. Extract frames from videos

```extract_frames_threads.py```

now set to 250 frames of each video, can be adjusted

### 3. (Optional) Data augmentation
```data_augmentation.py```

Applying some transformations to the frames in ```frames_dataset``` to improve accuracy. <br>
Save as a separate folder ```augmented_dataset``` .


### 4. Annotate the ball
```auto_annotate.py```
- Auto annotating balls in the extracted frames with a pre-trained YOLOv11m model on sports ball class (class 32).
- Ultralytics package is used.
- Annotations are only saved where more than 1 ball is detected
- Annotations are saved in normalised COCO bounding box format ```<class> <x_mid> <y_mid> <width> <height>```
- Alternative: Manually annotate or adjust a small dataset with tools like LabelImg or Roboflow
#### How to improve annotations?
Train a model with the initial annotations. Run ```auto_annotate.py``` again with the fine-tuned model. <br>
Make a copy of the initial annoatations as a checkpoint for the next steps


### 5. Organise files into training folders
```train_val_split_binary.py```

Copy files into folders to be read with the training function in Ultralytics package. <br>
Only frames with annotations are copied.


### 6. Updating class ID on annotation file
```update_class_id_binary.py``` 

Changing class ID of the annotations from 32 of the COCO dataset to 0 for a single class detection (Coarse class-count). <br>
(Alternative: to detect different balls (fine class-count), use ```update_class_id.py```, which redistributes class ID according to list of sports chosen)



## Training pipeline
```train.py```
- Loads a YOLOv8m pre-trained model for fine-tuning. (Other models can also be used. Model chosen now at computation limitations)
- Datasets and class configurations are stored in ```dataset_binary.yaml```
- training metrics saved in ```./runs/detect/train```


## Evaluation
```eval.py```
- Datasets and class configurations are stored in ```dataset_binary.yaml```
  - evaluated on test set, which the Ground Truths are also automactically annotated.
- Evaluation results are automatically generated by the eval() function of the Ultralytics package
  - Saved in ```./runs/detect/val```, containing Precision-Recall curves, confusion matricies and some test image visualisation


## Visualisation
```visualise_video.py```
Saves an annotated video randomly picked from the downloaded video dataset


## Improving dataset
- Run steps from 3. Annotate the ball again with the fine-tuned model
- Manually adjust some annotations
- Explore different data augmentation on ```data_augmentation.py``` 
- Explore Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI), Cross Validation

## Challenges
- Loading and filtering the dataset
  - The dataset .txt file is huge to read all into memory
- Videos from the dataset is no longer available on YouTube, less dataset than expected to download
- **[Main problem]** Video quality is very low, some videos are from more than 10 years ago with low resolution.
  - Many frames return with no detection on auto annotation with the pre-trained model
  - Videos contains many irrlevant content, e.g. no gameplay in the video at all
- Attempted to detect ball by different sports (fine class-count), but the dataset is very biased due to the reasons above
- Other lookalike items such as round logos are also detected as ball
- Evaluation results may not be accurate as Ground Truth was also auto annotated
